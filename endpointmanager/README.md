# FHIR Endpoint Manager

The FHIR Endpoint Manager is a service that coordinates the data capture and retrieval for FHIR endpoints.

## Configuration
The FHIR Endpoint Manager reads the following environment variables:

* **LANTERN_DBHOST**: The hostname where the database is hosted.

  Default value: localhost

* **LANTERN_DBPORT**: The port where the database is hosted.

  Default value: 5432

* **LANTERN_DBUSER**: The database user that the application will use to read and write from the database.

  Default value: lantern

* **LANTERN_DBPASSWORD**: The password for accessing the database as user LANTERN_DBUSER.

  Default value: postgrespassword

* **LANTERN_DBNAME**: The name of the database being accessed.

  Default value: lantern

* **LANTERN_DBSSLMODE**: The level of SSL certificate verification that is performed. For a production system, this should be set to 'verify-full'.

  Default value: disable

* **LANTERN_CHPLAPIKEY**: The key necessary for accessing CHPL

  Default value: <none>
  You can obtain a CHPL API key [here](https://chpl.healthit.gov/#/resources/chpl-api).

### Test Configuration

When testing, the FHIR Endpoint Manager uses the following environment variables:

* **LANTERN_TEST_DBUSER** instead of LANTERN_DBUSER: The database user that the application will use to read and write from the database.

  Default value: lantern

* **LANTERN_TEST_DBPASSWORD** instead of LANTERN_DBPASSWORD: The password for accessing the database as user LANTERN_TEST_DBUSER.

  Default value: postgrespassword

* **LANTERN_TEST_DBNAME** instead of LANTERN_DBNAME: The name of the database being accessed.

  Default value: lantern_test

## Building and Running

The Endpoint Manager currently just connects to the PostgreSQL database. All log messages are written to stdout. If the endpoint manager connects to the database successfully, you should expect to see "Successfully connected!" as the output.

The instructions below assume that you are in `endpointmanager/`.

The Endpoint Manager has not yet been dockerized. To run, perform the following commands:

```bash
go get ./... # You may have to set environment variable GO111MODULE=on
go mod download
go run cmd/main.go
```
