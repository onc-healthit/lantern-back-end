## Building and Running

The first time you run something, you may need to do the following in the directory where the main.go file is located:

```bash
go get ./... # You may have to set environment variable GO111MODULE=on
go mod download
```

### Base main.go

The Endpoint Manager main function is currently a stub function. You will see that the endpointmanager is running if you see "Started the endpoint manager." in as the output. 

Endpoint Manager functionality long term will rely on the lantern message queue (RabbitMQ) and the PostgreSQL database being available.

To run, perform the following commands:

```bash
cd endpointmanager/cmd
go run main.go
```

The commands below assume that you are starting in the root directory of the Lantern backend project.

### Archive File

### Expected Endpoint Source Formatting

The Endpoint Manager expects the format of an endpoint source list to be in one of the formats below:

Cerner Endpoint Sources (JSON):

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": <name of the organization>,
      "baseUrl": <location of the FHIR endpoint>,
      "type": <endpoint type>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Lantern Endpoint Sources (JSON):

```
{
  "Endpoints": [
    {
      "URL": <location of the FHIR endpoint>,
      "OrganizationName": <name of the organization>,
      "NPIID": <organization npi id>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

FHIR Bundle of FHIR Endpoint Resources (JSON):

```
{
   "resourceType": "Bundle",
   "entry": [
     {
       "resource": {
         "name": <name of the organization>,
         "managingOrganiation": { "display": <text for resource>, "reference": <organization name> },
         "address": <location of the FHIR endpoint>
       }
     },
     ...
   ]
}
```

NPPES Endpoint pfile (CSV):

```
"NPI","Endpoint Type","Endpoint Type Description","Endpoint","Affiliation","Endpoint Description","Affiliation Legal Business Name","Use Code","Use Description","Other Use Description","Content Type","Content Description","Other Content Description","Affiliation Address Line One","Affiliation Address Line Two","Affiliation Address City","Affiliation Address State","Affiliation Address Country","Affiliation Address Postal Code"
...
```

### Adding a New Endpoint List

To add a new endpoint list, add an entry to the EndpointResourcesList.json file located in the resources/prod_resources directory with the endpoint name, the name the endpoint source file will be saved as, and the endpoint URL. If the format does not match any of those listed above in the expected endpoint formats, add a new parser. See lantern-back-end/endpointmanager/pkg/fetcher/cernerlist.go, lantern-back-end/endpointmanager/pkg/fetcher/epiclist.go, or lantern-back-end/endpointmanager/pkg/fetcher/lanternlist.go for examples of the interface which endpoint list parsers need to adhere to.

## Endpoint Linker Algorithm Manual Corrections

To manually add a link between an endpoint and npi organization after the linker algorithm has been run, add the endpoint url and the npi id of the organization you want to link to the linkerMatchesAllowlist.json file. To manually remove a link between an endpoint and npi organization, add the linked endpoint url and the npi id of the organization you want to remove from the database to the linkerMatchesBlocklist.json file. Both files are found in the resources/prod_resources directory, and expect the following format:

```
[
  {
    "endpointURL": <url of endpoint>,
    "organizationID":<npi id of organization>
  },
  ...
]
```

## Endpoint Info History Pruning

The history pruning algorithm is run every 23 hours using a cron job (more details on how to set up in main README). The pruning algorithm will iterate over all of the fhir_endpoint_info_history entries for each distinct FHIR endpoint URL that have entered_at dates that are older than the time determined by subtracting the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD from the current time, and also have entered_at dates that are newer than the current time minus the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD times 2. Having a lower limit of the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD times 2 ensures that the algorithm does not repeat all of the pruning checks on the same entries after every 23 hours, but that it also does not miss any entries that have not yet been pruned. The LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD, which set to one month by default, ensures that there is always data newer than the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD that is not pruned, since an entry has to be older than the threshold in order to be considered for pruning.

The pruning algorithm will remove any consecutive duplicate entries in the fhir_endpoint_info_history table. A fhir_endpoint_info_history entry is considered a duplicate if there is an older consecutive entry that that has the same stored information for the endpoint's TLS version, MIME types, and SMART response, and if the newer entry's stored capability statement only differs by fields included in a list of ignored fields, such as the CapabilityStatement.date field. If a fhir_endpoint_info_history entry is found to be a duplicate of an older consecutive entry, it is deleted from the table, and this continues until only the oldest of the consecutive duplicated entries remains. This pruning strategy is advantageous in that there will always be a duration of at least LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD minutes worth of queries in the history table for each endpoint, therefore Lantern can inspect LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD minutes worth of data to see how every endpoint responded within each query interval while still saving storage space by removing duplicate data or data which only differs in the values reported for fields in the ignored fields set. Keeping all entries containing any unique data allows Lantern to keep track of how each endpoint has changed over long periods of time.
