## Packages

The Endpoint Manager includes many packages with distinct purposes.

### Capability Handler

Takes messages off of the queue that include the capability statements of endpoints as well as additional data about the http interaction with the endpoint. Processes the endpoints (including linking them) and adds the data to the database.

### Capability Parser

Creates a model for capability statements and makes specific attributes of a capability statement queryable within the code. Can parse DSTU2, STU3, and R4 capability statements.

### CHPL Mapper

Maps endpoints to CHPL vendors and stores the mapping in the database. Eventually will map endpoints to CHPL products as well as additional information becomes available.

### CHPL Querier

Queries the CHPL service for CHPL product information and stores in the database.

### Config

Manages the configuration variables for all of the Endpoint Manager services.

### Endpoint Manager

Handles the object models and database storage for the endpoint information that Lantern is gathering.

### FHIR Endpoint Querier

Adds a list of endpoints to the database.

### NPPES Querier

Reads in a CSV file of NPPES data. You can find the latest monthly export of NPPES data here: http://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html

## Building and Running

The first time you run something, you may need to do the following in the directory where the main.go file is located:

```bash
go get ./... # You may have to set environment variable GO111MODULE=on
go mod download
```

### Base main.go

The Endpoint Manager main function is currently a stub function. You will see that the endpointmanager is running if you see "Started the endpoint manager." in as the output. 

Endpoint Manager functionality long term will rely on the lantern message queue (RabbitMQ) and the PostgreSQL database being available.

To run, perform the following commands:

```bash
cd endpointmanager/cmd
go run main.go
```

The commands below assume that you are starting in the root directory of the Lantern backend project.

Primarily uses the `chplquerier` package.

To run, perform the following commands:

```bash
cd endpointmanager/cmd/chplquerier
go run main.go
```

### Endpoint Populator

go run main.go
```

### JSON Exporter
Creates a JSON export file by formatting the data from the fhir_endpoints_info and fhir_endpoints_info_history tables into a given specification.

Primarily uses the `jsonexport` package.

```bash
cd endpointmanager/cmd/jsonexport 
go run main.go <export JSON file name>
```

### History Pruning
Prunes the fhir_endpoints_info_history table to remove consecutive duplicate endpoint entries older than the pruning threshold environment variable.

Primarily uses the `historypruning` package.

```bash
cd endpointmanager/cmd/historypruning 
go run main.go
```

### Archive File
Creates an archive of the data from the fhir_endpoints, fhir_endpoints_info and vendors tables between the given dates in a JSON format and saves it to the given 'file' name.

Primarily uses the `archivefile` package.

```bash
cd endpointmanager/cmd/archivefile
go run main.go <start date> <end date> <file name>
```

### Expected Endpoint Source Formatting

The Endpoint Manager expects the format of an endpoint source list to be in one of the formats below:

Cerner Endpoint Sources (JSON):

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": <name of the organization>,
      "baseUrl": <location of the FHIR endpoint>,
      "type": <endpoint type>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Lantern Endpoint Sources (JSON):

```
{
  "Endpoints": [
    {
      "URL": <location of the FHIR endpoint>,
      "OrganizationName": <name of the organization>,
      "NPIID": <organization npi id>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

FHIR Bundle of FHIR Endpoint Resources (JSON):

```
{
   "resourceType": "Bundle",
   "entry": [
     {
       "resource": {
         "name": <name of the organization>,
         "managingOrganiation": { "display": <text for resource>, "reference": <organization name> },
         "address": <location of the FHIR endpoint>
       }
     },
     ...
   ]
}
```

NPPES Endpoint pfile (CSV):

```
"NPI","Endpoint Type","Endpoint Type Description","Endpoint","Affiliation","Endpoint Description","Affiliation Legal Business Name","Use Code","Use Description","Other Use Description","Content Type","Content Description","Other Content Description","Affiliation Address Line One","Affiliation Address Line Two","Affiliation Address City","Affiliation Address State","Affiliation Address Country","Affiliation Address Postal Code"
...
```

### Adding a New Endpoint List

To add a new endpoint list, add an entry to the EndpointResourcesList.json file located in the resources/prod_resources directory with the endpoint name, the name the endpoint source file will be saved as, and the endpoint URL. If the format does not match any of those listed above in the expected endpoint formats, add a new parser. See lantern-back-end/endpointmanager/pkg/fetcher/cernerlist.go, lantern-back-end/endpointmanager/pkg/fetcher/epiclist.go, or lantern-back-end/endpointmanager/pkg/fetcher/lanternlist.go for examples of the interface which endpoint list parsers need to adhere to.

## Endpoint Linker Algorithm Manual Corrections

To manually add a link between an endpoint and npi organization after the linker algorithm has been run, add the endpoint url and the npi id of the organization you want to link to the linkerMatchesAllowlist.json file. To manually remove a link between an endpoint and npi organization, add the linked endpoint url and the npi id of the organization you want to remove from the database to the linkerMatchesBlocklist.json file. Both files are found in the resources/prod_resources directory, and expect the following format:

```
[
  {
    "endpointURL": <url of endpoint>,
    "organizationID":<npi id of organization string>
  },
  ...
]
```

**Note:** The npi organizationID should be a string


## Endpoint Info History Pruning

After every query interval, once the capability querier has finished querying all endpoints and updating both the fhir_endpoint_info table and subsequently the fhir_endpoint_info_history table, the history pruning algorithm is run. The pruning algorithm will iterate over all of the fhir_endpoint_info_history entries for each distinct FHIR endpoint URL that have entered_at dates that are older than the time determined by subtracting the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD from the current time, and also have entered_at dates that are newer than the current time minus the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD plus three times the query interval. Having a lower limit of the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD time plus three times the query interval ensures that the algorithm does not repeat pruning checks on the same entries after every query interval, but that it also does not miss any entries that have not yet been pruned. The LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD, which set to one month by default, ensures that there is always data newer than the LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD that is not pruned, since an entry has to be older than the threshold in order to be considered for pruning.

The pruning algorithm will remove any consecutive duplicate entries in the fhir_endpoint_info_history table. A fhir_endpoint_info_history entry is considered a duplicate if there is an older consecutive entry that that has the same stored information for the endpoint's TLS version, MIME types, and SMART response, and if the newer entry's stored capability statement only differs by fields included in a list of ignored fields, such as the CapabilityStatement.date field. If a fhir_endpoint_info_history entry is found to be a duplicate of an older consecutive entry, it is deleted from the table, and this continues until only the oldest of the consecutive duplicated entries remains. This pruning strategy is advantageous in that there will always be a duration of at least LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD minutes worth of queries in the history table for each endpoint, therefore Lantern can inspect LANTERN_PRUNING_THRESHOLD minutes worth of data to see how every endpoint responded within each query interval while still saving storage space by removing duplicate data or data which only differs in the values reported for fields in the ignored fields set. Keeping all entries containing any unique data allows Lantern to keep track of how each endpoint has changed over long periods of time.
