        <h2>What is Lantern?</h2>
        <p>
            Lantern is an open source tool developed by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and Mettle Solutions, LLC. that monitors and
            provides analytics about the availability and adoption of FHIR API service base URLs (endpoints) across healthcare organizations in the United States. It also gathers
            information about FHIR Capability Statements returned by these endpoints and provides visualizations to show FHIR adoption and patient data availability.
        </p>
        <h2>What data does Lantern collect, and how is it collected?</h2>
        <p>
            Lantern queries FHIR API endpoints that are published in lists made publicly available by health IT system developers, querying the FHIR APIs to establish their availability, 
            and monitoring changes to the FHIR APIs that may signal noncompliance. Lantern gathers and combines data from FHIR API endpoints​, from the Certified Health IT Product List 
            (CHPL) database for product and developer information for provider organization information and links the FHIR APIs to those products and organizations when possible.
