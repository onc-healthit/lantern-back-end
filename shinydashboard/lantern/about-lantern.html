        <h3>What is Lantern?</h3>
        <p>
            Lantern is an open source tool for monitoring fielded health IT systems’ certified FHIR API endpoints.
            It gathers uptime, response time, capability statements, and more from FHIR API endpoints, and provides visualizations to 
            show FHIR adoption and patient data availability across the nation, as well as details for specific FHIR API endpoints. 
            Lantern helps to ensure that patients will have digital access to their data by providing visibility into levels of FHIR adoption 
            and FHIR endpoint availability and usablity. The results will be viewed by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information 
            Technology (ONC), supporting the adoption of health information technology and the promotion of nationwide health information exchange. 
            The visualizations and data that Lantern provides to the ONC will reduce the ONC’s effort to evaluate the use of the FHIR standard, inform 
            future ONC program criteria for the FHIR standard, and reduce ONC’s risk of adopting immature standards in future ONC program criteria.

        <h3>What data does Lantern collect, and how is it collected?</h3>
        <p>
            Lantern provides its monitoring service to ONC by collecting all known FHIR API endpoints for health IT systems certified under ONC’s Health IT
            Certification Program, querying the FHIR APIs to establish their availability, and monitoring changes to the FHIR APIs that may signal noncompliance. 
            Lantern also gathers information on the certified health IT products, their vendor organizations, and existing health provider organizations, 
            and links the FHIR APIs to those products and organizations when possible. Lantern gathers and combines data from FHIR API endpoints​, from the Epic, Cerner, 
            and CareEvolution endpoint lists​, from the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) database for product and vendor information, and from the  National Plan & Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) 
            for provider organization information.
