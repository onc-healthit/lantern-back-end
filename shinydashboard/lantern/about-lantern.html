        <h3>What is Lantern?</h3>
        <p>
            Lantern is an open source tool developed by the MITRE Corporation for monitoring fielded health IT systems’ certified FHIR API endpoints. It gathers availability information and information about 
            FHIR support from endpoints’ capability statements and provides visualizations to show FHIR adoption and patient data availability across the nation. Lantern helps to ensure 
            that patients will have digital access to their data by providing visibility into levels of FHIR adoption as well as FHIR endpoint availability and usability. 
            
        </p>
        <h3>What data does Lantern collect, and how is it collected?</h3>
        <p>
            Lantern queries FHIR API endpoints that are published in lists made publicly available by  health IT system vendors, querying the FHIR APIs to establish their availability, 
            and monitoring changes to the FHIR APIs that may signal noncompliance. Lantern gathers and combines data from FHIR API endpoints​, from the Certified Health IT Product List 
            (CHPL) database for product and vendor information, and from the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) for provider organization information and links the FHIR APIs to those products and organizations when possible.
